# Dynasty
A cross-platform native desktop application for trading cryptocurrency. Only Binance and Spot Trading are supported for now. The tool is made for my personal use, but feature requests and/or issues are welcome.
To use set DYN_PUB and DYN_SEC environment variables to your Binance API keys respectively.
